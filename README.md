# PDFBlackener

PDFBlackener is a simple library to blacken/redact pdfs. As Pdfs are incredibly tricky constructs and you can use multiple techniques to retrieve data from a blackened pdf, PDFBlackener may additionally convert all pdf pages to images. The resulting pdf will only contain images and no more information retrieval is possible.
